## TL;DR

[describe in one sentence what this project is about].

From the [Pudding](https://pudding.cool/pitch/), What Makes a Good Story?
> The idea is worthy of public discourse. Would people debate the premise of the idea for 20 minutes? What assumptions does it challenge? There’s a deeper truth What does the story reveal (even if it’s buried deep in the essay)? Does the reader leave the essay feeling differently? You’re showing, not telling. Visuals make your argument more accessible and less complex than a thousand-word essay.

## Technical prowess (optional)

 - Key technical features or tools that this story will illustrate, e.g. 
    - We use [principled data processing](https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/modular-auditable-reproducible.html) to orchestrate the data pipeline
    - We use Svelte 5's new [universal reactivity files](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/universal-reactivity) with [Duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/wasm/overview.html) data loaders to implement a well organized and performant data dashboard. 
   - ...

Those technical features will be elaborated in our blog. The idea here is to "show and tell" good (or experimental) software development practices through the stories.
