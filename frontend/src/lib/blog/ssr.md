# Welcome to Our Blog

This is our first markdown blog post! We can use all the features of markdown here.

## Mathematical Equations

Thanks to our KaTeX integration, we can write beautiful equations:

$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi$$

## Code Blocks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, Complex Systems!";
console.log(greeting);
```
