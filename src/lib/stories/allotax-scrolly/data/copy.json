If, say, <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{topName2023}}</span> and <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{secondName2023}}</span> were very frequent both now and then, exactly as frequent, they would rank high on both axes, and sit on the diagonal."

Now, you'll notice that as you hover over less frequent types, they tend to have more types in them. This is because each cell represents the number of times baby names appear; there is only one <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{topName2023}}</span>, appearing hundreds or thousands of times, while there are many names that appear only once or twice, like <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{lastName1980}}</span> or <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{secondLastName1990}}</span>. The legend indicates the scale, with darker colors showing there are more counts per cell."

The bottom right plot helps keep track of the contribution from each system in the shared vocabulary, as we throw out any names that are not shared between the two systems. As discussed in the analysis, we can see that <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{surpriseName}}</span> was in the tail in <span class=\"year-1980\">1980</span>, before ranking much higher in <span class=\"year-2023\">2023</span>."
