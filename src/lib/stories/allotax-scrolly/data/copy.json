If, say, <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{topName2023}}</span> and <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{secondName2023}}</span> were very frequent both now and then, exactly as frequent, they will rank both high on the axis, and sit on the diagonal."

Now, you'll notice that as you hover on less frequent types, they tend to have more types in it. This is because each cell represents the number of times a baby names appear; there is only one <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{topName2023}}</span>, appearing hundred or thousand times, while there are many names that appear only once or twice, like <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{lastName1980}}</span> or <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{secondLastName1990}}</span>. The legend is indicating the scale, with darker color showing there are more counts per cell."

The bottom right plot help keeping track of the contribution from each system in the shared vocabulary, as we throw out any names that are not shared between the two systems. As discussed in the analysis, we can see that <span class=\"name-highlight\">{{surpriseName}}</span> was in the tail in <span class=\"year-1980\">1980</span>, before ranking much higher in <span class=\"year-2023\">2023</span>.
