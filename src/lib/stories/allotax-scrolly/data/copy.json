Now, you'll notice that as you hover on less frequent types, they tend to have more types in it. This is because each cell represents the number of times a baby names appear; there is only one John, appearing 8 thousands times, while there are many names that appear only once or twice, like 'Alpheus' or 'Woodie'. The legend shows the number of counts per cell, that is how many types have ranked in that cell. "
