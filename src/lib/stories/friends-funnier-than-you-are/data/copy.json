In 1845, French mathematician [Irénée-Jules Bienaymé](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ir%C3%A9n%C3%A9e-Jules_Bienaym%C3%A9) studied aristocratic family extinction during Victorian times, developing the mathematical framework to answer whether noble bloodlines would survive. His work, largely forgotten, was later rediscovered through the famous collaboration between [Francis Galton and Henry Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton%E2%80%93Watson_process) in the 1870s, who posed the question: what proportion of family surnames would become extinct after many generations?"

Some will die out immediately, others will grow modestly, and a few might explode into massive cascades. The distribution of these cascade sizes reveals deep patterns about how parts of the system _scale_ together."

Throughout the 20th century, scaling concepts appeared across science: how organisms grow (allometric scaling), self-repeating patterns in nature (fractals), and computational complexity. But it was the explosion of digital social data in the 2000s that revealed how cascade size distributions in online systems follow these same scaling principles, opening entirely new questions about social contagion."

This creates 'heavy-tailed' distributions, where, unlike human height or brain size which cluster around typical values, cascade sizes have no characteristic scale—there's always the possibility of something orders of magnitude larger. This is the mathematics of systems by which we're repeatedly surprised by events much larger than we expect. "

Why this particular number? It emerges in systems poised at *criticality*, the precise mathematical point where branching processes balance between dying out and growing explosively. Systems with completely different mechanisms—neurons firing, trees burning, neutrons splitting—somehow converge on this same mathematical signature when they operate near this critical threshold."

Empirical studies of social media cascades consistently show much steeper decay than the 3/2 prediction, with scaling exponents ranging from τ = 2 to 4. Twitter retweets, Facebook shares, and viral content all decay faster than critical branching processes predict, meaning massive viral events are rarer than the theory suggests. This systematic deviation points to something fundamental: real social cascades aren't simply branching processes with fixed rules. Instead, they hint at another mechanism lacking in classical branching processes: *self-reinforcing cascade*."

A few people are exceptionally funny — their jokes (high intensity k) spread much further, so they reach many more listeners. When we ask ourselves how many people total are gonna hear the joke you might have told first, the odds are much higher that it came from one of those “exceptionally funny” people, simply because their jokes dominate the total audience."

This contrasts sharply with traditional cascade models that only exhibit power-law behavior at a precise critical point."

      "type": "markdown",
      "value": "Compare that to the classical branching process, where each person passes on the item (joke, belief, virus) to a random number of others, with some fixed reproduction distribution. At the critical point (where $R_0 = 1$) the size distribution of cascades is a power law. Away from criticality, the cascade size distribution has an exponential cutoff. That's why in ordinary branching models, heavy tails are fragile: they only appear exactly at criticality."
