We implement this by reshuffling the network’s edges every 500 milliseconds, effectively sampling a new adjacency matrix each time. This corresponds to the assumption that network structure changes much faster than the dynamics evolving on top of it."

      "value": "We let the dynamics run, taking note every time the two nodes are in contact — that is, measuring their contact duration. At an infection rate $r = 0.2$ (per second), it will take on average  $t = \\frac{1}{r} = 5$  seconds of contact for an infection to occur — at which point the susceptible node turns red. This is because we’re assuming a small probability of infection per unit of contact time. If each contact lasts s  seconds, then the probability of infection during that contact is approximately: $$\\newline P(\\text{infection in contact}) = 1 - \\exp(-r⋅s) ≈ r⋅s \\newline$$ (for small s, the exponential approximates linearly) So, if contacts are short — say  $s = 1$  second — it takes $\\frac{t}{s} = 5$ contact events on average before the infection happens. Longer contacts mean infection is more likely to happen in a single encounter. Shorter contacts require repeated interactions. "
