We can corroborate this information by looking up his CV, which indicates that his PhD was indeed at <span style='color:#FF6B35; font-weight:bold;'>MIT</span>, while he did a postdoc at <span style='color:#4682B4; font-weight:bold;'>Columbia</span>, but not at the <span style='color:#B59410; font-weight:bold;'>Santa Fe Institute</span>.

It varies dramatically by domain, and even within a domain. Some researchers collaborate extensively outside of their home institutions.",
